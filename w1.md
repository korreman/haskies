# Week 1
The first week is about functions and expressions.

Topics
------
* Installation and using `ghci`.
  [Use this page to install!](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
* Documentation can be found at [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org).
* Declaration of functions
  - Type declaration syntax. Always declare the types of functions!
* Partial application (currying).
* Infix operators and infix functions (```x `someFunc` y```)
* [Operators on functions](https://github.com/korreman/haskies/blob/master/application_composition.md) (`(.)`, `(>>>)`, `($)`, `(&)`)
* `let _ = _ in _` and the mostly equivalent `where`-clauses
* Pattern matching (really just `case _ of ...` instead of `match _ with ...`)
  - Guards (conditions in pattern matching)
  - Pattern matching in a function declaration.
* Lambdas

The point is to realize that it's mostly about types and functions, not values.
Functions can be easily created, combined, and passed around, and this is one of
Haskell's strengths.

Random notes
------------
```
someFunc x y z = x + y + z
```
Is equivalent to:
```
someFunc = \ x -> \ y -> \ z -> x + y + z
```

To pattern match in a function declaration, you simply write a value (or part of
it) instead of an argument. Then you write multiple function declarations. So:
```
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum xs =
  case xs of
    x:xs -> x + sum xs
    [] -> 0
```
Is equivalent to (parentheses are necessary):
```
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
```

Guards can also be made part of the function declaration:
```
faculty :: Int -> Int
faculty x =
  if x <= 1
    then 1
    else x * faculty (x - 1)
```
Is the same as:
```
faculty x =
  case x of
    x | x <= 1 -> 1
    x -> x * faculty (x - 1)
```
Is the same as:
```
faculty x | x <= 1    = 1
faculty x | otherwise = x * faculty (x - 1)
```
