# Haskies
Resources for a Haskell mini-course. A somewhat simpler language is used to
explain things. This is done in the belief that terms like `Functor`, `Monad`,
and `Currying` do more harm than good.

* [Week 1](https://github.com/korreman/haskies/blob/master/w1.md) - Functions
  and expressions
* [Week 2](https://github.com/korreman/haskies/blob/master/w2.md) - IO

Eventual topics:
* Lists
* Algebraic data types
  - Trees
* Record syntax
* Input/Output
* Typeclasses
* Contexts (type constructors)
* Useful context instances (`map`, `merge`, `join`, `accum`)
* Control types (type constructors for functions)
* Container types
* Context extenders
* Making our own contexts
